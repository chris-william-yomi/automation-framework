"""
Professional logging utilities for automation debugging.

This module provides a comprehensive logging system that integrates with
the debugging infrastructure to provide detailed, contextual logs for
both successful operations and failures. It ensures all automation events
are properly recorded for analysis and troubleshooting.

The logging system implements a hierarchical approach with multiple output
channels, ensuring appropriate information reaches the right audience while
maintaining comprehensive audit trails for post-mortem analysis. It provides
seamless integration with the debug helper system to automatically capture
relevant artifacts during error conditions.

Example:
    >>> from utils.logger import automation_logger
    >>> automation_logger.info("Starting login flow")
    >>> # During failure
    >>> automation_logger.capture_debug_info(driver, context="login_test")

    Professional logging system for automation with integrated debug capture.

    This class provides a comprehensive logging solution that not only records

    The implementation follows best practices for enterprise logging including
    structured logging formats, multi-channel output, and automatic debug
