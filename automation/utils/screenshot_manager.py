Screenshot management utilities for cross-platform debugging.

This module provides a unified interface for capturing screenshots regardless
of whether the failure originated from Selenium, PyAutoGUI, or other sources.
It ensures consistent naming, storage, and retrieval of debug screenshots.

Example:
    >>> from utils.screenshot_manager import ScreenshotManager
    >>> manager = ScreenshotManager()
    >>> # In a test
    >>> try:
    ...     # Some failing operation
    ...     pass
    ... except Exception:
    ...     screenshot_path = manager.capture_on_failure(
    ...         context="login_flow",
    ...         error_type="ElementNotFound"
    ...     )
    ...     print(f"Screenshot saved: {screenshot_path}")

    Manages screenshot capture for debugging purposes across different platforms.

    This class provides a unified interface for taking screenshots when failures
    occur, regardless of whether they originate from web automation (Selenium)
    or desktop automation (PyAutoGUI). It handles file naming, directory
    organization, and platform-specific considerations. The implementation
    prioritizes reliability by implementing multiple fallback strategies
    for different operating systems and available libraries.

    The manager supports both system-level screenshots and driver-specific
    screenshots for web automation, ensuring comprehensive coverage of
    different automation scenarios. It also provides automatic cleanup
    capabilities to prevent disk space issues from accumulating screenshots.

        Capture a screenshot immediately upon failure with descriptive naming.

        This method implements a multi-platform approach to screenshot capture,
        automatically detecting the operating system and using the most

        filename that incorporates the context, error type, and timestamp
        for easy identification during debugging sessions.

        screenshot availability even when primary capture methods fail,
        making it robust for production environments where debugging
        information is critical.
