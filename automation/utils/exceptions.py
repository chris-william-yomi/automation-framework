"""
automation_framework.utils.exceptions - Defines custom error types for automation failures.

This module provides specialized exception classes that handle different types of
automation errors with detailed context information. Instead of generic Python
exceptions, these custom errors capture specific details about what went wrong
during automation, making debugging much easier.

The module includes:
- AutomationError: Base class for all automation-related exceptions
- ElementNotFoundError: When UI elements can't be located on the page
- ActionFailedError: When elements exist but interactions fail (click, type, etc.)
- NavigationError: When page navigation encounters problems
- PyAutoGUIError: When desktop automation operations fail

Each exception stores relevant debugging information like component names,
actions performed, and contextual details to help identify the root cause quickly.

class AutomationError(Exception):
    """Base exception for all automation-related failures providing structured error context.

    This exception serves as the foundation for all automation-specific errors,
    capturing essential debugging information including the component where
    the error occurred, the action being performed, and additional context
    that helps identify the root cause of failures. The exception automatically
    formats a comprehensive error message combining all available context
    information for immediate troubleshooting visibility.

    The design allows for rich error tracking without losing the original
    exception chain, making it suitable for both manual debugging and
    automated error reporting systems.

    This exception handles cases where the target element exists but the

    include attempting to click disabled buttons, typing into read-only fields,
    selecting options from disabled dropdowns, or performing actions when
    the UI is in an unexpected state.

    Unlike ElementNotFoundError which indicates missing elements, this
    exception signals that the element exists but the requested action
    cannot proceed due to state constraints, permissions, or UI behavior

    period. It's commonly encountered in web automation when dealing with
    dynamic content loading, asynchronous updates, or UI changes that weren't
    anticipated in the test design.

    The exception captures the element identifier, search criteria used,

    particularly useful for identifying issues with URL routing, authentication
