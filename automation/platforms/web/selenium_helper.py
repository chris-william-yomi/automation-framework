"""
automation_framework.platforms.web.selenium_helper - Comprehensive Selenium automation helper.

This module provides SeleniumHelper, a robust wrapper around Selenium WebDriver
that simplifies common web automation tasks. It includes methods for element
detection, interaction, waiting, and JavaScript execution with built-in error
handling and logging integration.

The helper supports multiple locator strategies (XPath, CSS, data-testid, etc.)
and provides flexible waiting conditions (clickable, visible, present).
It handles common automation challenges like dynamic content loading,
element state verification, and cross-browser compatibility issues.

Key Features:
- Multiple element finding strategies with smart waiting
- Text input/output operations with file integration
- JavaScript execution support
- Scroll and navigation utilities
- Automated error handling with detailed context
- Integration with framework's logging and exception systems

Example Usage:
    >>> from automation_framework.platforms.web.selenium_helper import SeleniumHelper
    >>> helper = SeleniumHelper(driver)
    >>> element = helper.find_by_data_test_id("submit-button")
    >>> helper.click_element(element)

        Retrieve the corresponding Selenium ExpectedCondition function based on a descriptive string identifier.

        This utility method acts as a translation layer between human-readable condition names
        and their corresponding Selenium ExpectedCondition functions. It provides a standardized
        way to access different types of element wait conditions without requiring direct
        knowledge of the Selenium EC module's function names. This abstraction simplifies
        the implementation of dynamic wait conditions and reduces the risk of typos or
        incorrect function references.

        The method maintains a comprehensive mapping of supported condition types and
        validates input parameters to ensure only valid conditions are processed,
        preventing runtime errors from unsupported condition requests.

        Args:
            condition (str): A string identifier representing the desired wait condition.
                            Supported values include:
                            - 'clickable': Maps to EC.element_to_be_clickable() - waits for element to be present, visible, and enabled
                            - 'visible': Maps to EC.visibility_of_element_located() - waits for element to be present and visible

        Safely retrieve the current page URL from the WebDriver instance with graceful error handling.

        This protective wrapper method provides a reliable way to access the current page URL
        while handling potential issues that may arise from driver unavailability, connection
        problems, or driver state inconsistencies. Instead of allowing exceptions to propagate,
        this method catches potential errors and returns a safe default value, ensuring that
        calling code can continue execution without interruption.

        The method is particularly valuable in scenarios where URL information is beneficial
        but not critical, such as logging, debugging, or optional validation steps where
        a failed URL retrieval shouldn't halt the entire automation process.

        rendered in a visible state. An element is considered visible if it has a width
        and height greater than 0 and is not hidden through CSS properties like
        display:none or visibility:hidden.

        This is essential for ensuring that elements are ready for user interactions
        like clicking, typing, or reading text content. It prevents attempts to interact
        with elements that exist in the DOM but are not currently visible to users.

        Args:
            xpath (str): XPath expression targeting the element whose visibility should be checked.
                        Should uniquely identify the element that needs to be visible.

        DOM, is visually rendered and visible, and is enabled for user interaction. An
        element is considered clickable when it's not disabled, not read-only (for inputs),

        Confirm that an element has been completely removed from the DOM structure.

        This method actively monitors for the absence of a specified element,
        returning True only when the element no longer exists in the HTML document
        structure. It's particularly valuable for verifying that loading indicators,
        temporary notifications, modal overlays, or other transient elements have
        been successfully removed from the page.

        The method waits for the element to be completely absent from the DOM,
        distinguishing between elements that are hidden (still in DOM) versus

        Returns:

        These attributes are intentionally stable and maintainable, making them the most reliable
        choice for automation locators that won't break during routine UI updates or refactoring.

        The method combines CSS selector efficiency with flexible wait conditions, allowing you to

        Locate and retrieve an element by checking if an attribute contains a specific substring.

        This method is particularly valuable for finding elements with dynamically generated
        or changing attributes where only a portion of the attribute value remains consistent.
        Common use cases include elements with auto-generated class names, dynamic IDs,
        or versioned attributes where a stable prefix or suffix exists.

        The method uses CSS selector partial matching which is efficient and widely supported
        across different browsers. It provides flexible searching capabilities that can
        handle various attribute types and maintains consistency with standard CSS selector
        syntax that developers are familiar with.

            attribute_value_part (str): The substring value to look for within the specified attribute.
                                The search will match any attribute value that contains
                                this substring, regardless of position within the value.
            tag (str, optional): The HTML tag type to search within. Use "*" (default) to
                                search across all tag types, or specify a particular tag
                                like "input", "div", "button", etc. for more targeted searches.

        Locate an element based on its spatial relationship to a reference element.

        This method leverages Selenium 4's advanced relative locator capabilities to
        find elements based on their visual position relative to other elements on
        the page. This approach is particularly powerful for finding elements in
        complex layouts, tables, forms, or dynamic interfaces where traditional
        locators might be unreliable due to positioning changes or dynamic content.

        The method first locates the reference (base) element, then searches for
        the target element in the specified spatial relationship. This two-step
        approach ensures accurate positioning calculations and handles scenarios
        where elements may be temporarily obscured or moving.

    def execute_js_script(self, script: str, *args):
        """
        Execute a JavaScript script in the current browser context and return the result.

        This method provides direct access to the browser's JavaScript execution engine,
        enabling advanced interactions that may not be possible through standard Selenium
        commands. It's particularly useful for manipulating page elements, triggering
        JavaScript events, modifying page state, or retrieving complex data structures
        from the browser.

        The method accepts variable arguments that can be passed to the JavaScript
        function, allowing for dynamic script execution with runtime parameters.

        Args:
            script (str): The JavaScript code to execute. Can be a simple expression
                    or a complex function call. The script should return a value
                    that can be serialized by Selenium's JavaScript engine.
            *args: Variable arguments to pass to the JavaScript function. These arguments
                    will be available within the script execution context and can include
                    strings, numbers, booleans, or WebElements.

        Returns:
            The result of the JavaScript execution, which can be a primitive value
            (string, number, boolean), an array, an object, or None depending on
            what the script returns. Selenium automatically converts JavaScript
            objects to Python equivalents where possible.

        Example:
            >>> helper = SeleniumHelper(driver)
            >>> # Get the current scroll position
            >>> scroll_pos = helper.execute_js_script("return window.pageYOffset;")
            >>> # Highlight an element with red border
            >>> element = driver.find_element(By.ID, "my-element")
            >>> helper.execute_js_script("arguments[0].style.border='3px solid red'", element)

        Read content from a text file and populate a web input field or text area with its contents.

        This method streamlines the process of entering large amounts of text into web forms
        by reading content from external files rather than embedding it directly in test code.
        It's particularly valuable for testing scenarios involving content management,
        document uploads, or form submissions with substantial text inputs.

        The method handles file reading with proper encoding, waits for the target element
        to reach the specified readiness state, optionally clears existing content, and then
        simulates user typing to populate the field. This approach ensures that JavaScript
        events are properly triggered and form validation occurs as expected.

        Args:
            file_path (str): The complete path to the text file containing the content to insert.
                        The file must be readable and contain UTF-8 encoded text.
                        Example: "/path/to/content/article.txt" or "./test_data/input.md"
            locator (Tuple[By, str]): A tuple containing the locator strategy and value
                        to identify the target input field or text area.
                        Example: (By.ID, "content-editor") or (By.CSS_SELECTOR, "textarea[name='description']")
            clear_before_insert (bool, optional): When True (default), clears any existing
                        content in the target element before
                        inserting the new text. Set to False to
                        append to existing content.
            wait_time (Optional[int], optional): Maximum time in seconds to wait for the
                        target element to meet the specified condition.
                        If None (default), uses the class's
                        default_timeout value set during initialization.
            condition (str, optional): The expected state condition the target element
                        must satisfy before text insertion. Valid options are.
                        - 'clickable': Element must be present, visible, and enabled
                        - 'visible': Element must be present and visible
                        - 'present': Element must be present in the DOM (any state)
                        Defaults to 'clickable' for interactive input fields.

            FileNotFoundError: When the specified file_path does not exist or is not accessible.
                        The exception includes the file path for easy identification.

            ElementNotFoundError: When the target element cannot be located within the
                        specified timeout period under the requested condition.
                        The exception includes detailed context about the search
                        parameters and current page state.
            ActionFailedError: When clearing the element or sending keys fails after the
                        element is successfully located. This may indicate issues
                        with element state, permissions, or JavaScript interference.

        Wait for an element to reach the specified state and perform a click action.

        This method provides a reliable way to interact with elements by first ensuring
        they are in the appropriate state for interaction before attempting to click.
        It combines element location with readiness verification and action execution
        in a single, atomic operation that handles timing and synchronization concerns.

        The method supports different readiness conditions to accommodate various
        element types and states, ensuring that clicks are only attempted when
        the element is ready for interaction. This prevents common issues like
        clicking on invisible or disabled elements.

            wait_time (Optional[int], optional): Maximum time in seconds to wait for the
                        element to meet the specified condition.

    def close_current_tab(self) -> str:
        """
        Close the currently focused browser tab or window and return the URL of the closed tab.

        This method safely closes the active browser tab or window, handling the operation
        with proper error management and logging. When closing the last remaining tab,
        the entire WebDriver session will terminate. The method captures the current URL
        before closing the tab, allowing for proper session tracking and cleanup.

        This operation is particularly useful for managing multiple tabs during complex
        automation scenarios or cleaning up resources after completing specific tasks.
        The caller should be aware that focus will shift to another available tab after
        the current one is closed, or the driver will become invalid if no other tabs exist.

        Returns:
            str: The URL of the tab that was successfully closed. Returns 'Unknown_Closed_Tab'
                if the URL could not be retrieved before closing due to driver unavailability
                or connection issues. This allows callers to track which page was on the

        Terminate the entire WebDriver session, closing all associated windows and tabs.

        This method performs a complete shutdown of the WebDriver session, terminating
        all browser instances and releasing all associated resources. Unlike closing
        individual tabs, this operation ends the entire automation session and invalidates
        the WebDriver instance. This should typically be called at the end of test
        execution or when all automation tasks are complete.

        The method includes comprehensive error handling to ensure proper cleanup even
        if the quit operation encounters issues. It captures the current URL before
        termination for logging and debugging purposes, though this may not be possible
        if the driver is already in an invalid state.

        Returns:
